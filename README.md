For Rendering Component as a web page, we need to use BrowserRouter Method. In this method, We specify the url using "path" attribute in Route tag and render component using "element" attribute in Route tag.

If we want to redirect/navigate to a required url or web page, for that we have to use useNavigate hook. In this hook, we specify the required url and it automatically set the the url and render the required component.
